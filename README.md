# heluna-parser

This is a simple parser for the Heluna language. This code base is a work in progress as I rework the language to fix some of the less pleasant parts of the syntax and introduce this new cleaner implementation.

The parser does not currently implement the full syntax. Read the comment at the top of index.js to see what has currently been implemented and refer to the heluna_syntax.txt document for the full syntax at this point.
